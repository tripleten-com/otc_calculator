# TripleTen: On-Time Completion (OTC) Calculator Guide

Welcome! This guide is designed to help Learning Coaches, and any team members understand how the OTC Calculator works. It requires **no coding experience** to understand. 

The calculator takes the guesswork out of determining a student's final deadlines by processing three simple things: their **Program**, the **Date** they started, and the current date (**Today**).

## 1. The Master Program Table

Every program has a **Standard Duration** (how long it takes to finish if they stay perfectly on track). The **OTC Deadline** is the absolute final limit, which is always calculated as **1.5x the Standard Duration**.

Some programs change their standard duration depending on the specific date the student enrolled. The calculator automatically checks this table behind the scenes:

| Program Name | Enrollment Dates | Standard Duration | OTC Deadline (1.5x) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software Engineering (PT)** | All Dates | 266 days | **399 days** |
| **Software Engineering (FT)** | Nov 14, 2024 – May 14, 2025<br>May 15, 2025 – Dec 29, 2025<br>Dec 30, 2025 – onwards | 120 days<br>126 days<br>154 days | **180 days**<br>**189 days**<br>**231 days** |
| **Cyber Security (PT)** | Nov 14, 2024 – Dec 29, 2025<br>Dec 30, 2025 – Feb 12, 2026<br>Feb 13, 2026 – onwards | 196 days<br>203 days<br>210 days | **294 days**<br>**304 days**<br>**315 days** |
| **Cyber Security (FT)** | Nov 14, 2024 – Dec 29, 2025<br>Dec 30, 2025 – Feb 12, 2026<br>Feb 13, 2026 – onwards | 91 days<br>112 days<br>119 days | **136 days**<br>**168 days**<br>**178 days** |
| **Data Science** | Nov 14, 2024 – Mar 09, 2025<br>Mar 10, 2025 – onwards | 224 days<br>231 days | **336 days**<br>**346 days** |
| **UX/UI Design** | Nov 14, 2024 – May 14, 2025<br>May 15, 2025 – onwards | 140 days<br>147 days | **210 days**<br>**220 days** |
| **AI Software Eng (PT)** | Nov 14, 2024 – May 13, 2026 *(gap: Jan 23, 2026 – Mar 11, 2026 — not available)*<br>May 14, 2026 – onwards | 168 days<br>196 days | **252 days**<br>**294 days** |
| **AI Software Eng (FT)** | All Dates *(gap: Jan 23, 2026 – Mar 11, 2026 — not available)* | 98 days | **147 days** |
| **AI & Machine Learning** | All Dates | 252 days | **378 days** |
| **Quality Assurance** | All Dates | 140 days | **210 days** |
| **Business Intelligence** | Nov 14, 2024 – Feb 19, 2026 *(program retired after this date)* | 112 days | **168 days** |
| **AI Automation** | All Dates | 98 days | **147 days** |
| **Data Analytics** | Mar 26, 2026 – onwards | 98 days | **147 days** |

## 2. Step-by-Step: How It Works

When you input a student's information into the calculator, here is exactly what it is doing for you step-by-step:

### Step 1: Finding the Standard End Date
The calculator looks at the exact day the student started their cohort (e.g., Nov 14, 2024). It then checks the table above to find out how many days long their specific program is. 
* *Result:* The **Standard End Date** is exactly where the student would finish if they stayed perfectly on track.

### Step 2: Finding the Absolute "OTC Deadline"
Every program follows the **1.5x rule**. The calculator takes the standard enrollment period and multiplies it by 1.5 to find the final cut-off. 
* *Result:* The **OTC Deadline** is the absolute final day they can finish the program and keep their on-time completion guarantee. **This date is non-negotiable.**

### Step 3: Determining Progress
The calculator automatically compares "Today's" date to the student's start date and their absolute deadline. 
* *Result:* This informs their position on the **Timeline Progress Bar**. 

### Step 4: Displaying the Final Verdict (Status)
The calculator determines if the student is still eligible for the guarantee based on the current date:
* **✅ Within Regular Time:** They are still before their Standard End Date. They are on the fast track!
* **⏳ Within OTC Period (Eligible):** They have passed their standard end date but are still under the 1.5x limit. Their guarantee is still safe.
* **❌ Exceeded OTC Deadline:** They have passed the 1.5x limit. They are no longer eligible for the Guarantee.

### Step 5: The Legal Notice Red Flag
If a student passes their OTC Deadline, a red **Legal Notice Required** banner will appear. 
* *Result:* The banner will explicitly state **"Send after [OTC Deadline Date]"**. This tells you exactly when the formal notification must be processed as per internal legal procedures.

## 3. Why This Matters
For you and your team, this calculator completely eliminates human error. You don't need to manually calculate complex 1.5x ratios or worry about changing program tiers. Just select the program and the start date, and the tool ensures legal compliance and operational accuracy!
